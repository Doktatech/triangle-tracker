## Description
This is a calculator that identifies if a triangle is a scalene, isosceles or an equilateral triangle. Furthermore the app is able to identify if a triangle does not exists when the sum of two of its sides is less than the third side. 
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* HTML 5 supportive browser
* NO server needed
*No dependencies.

## Known Bugs
No bugs for the latest update.
## Technologies Used
 The code is well written using HTML5, CSS and Javascript for styling. For full funcionality, we focused on knowing what inputs we wanted to drive what outputs. First we identified an equilateral triangle as one whose three sides are all equal. So we needed an input of three similar measurements to output an alert of "equilateral" triangle. In a similar working, we identified a scalene triangle, an isosceles triangle and "no-triangle" inputs and outputs. Finally, we drove our written document into the implementation stage in atom. This way the idea was implemented well making the code run with few bugs to correct.
