      <h1>Triangle Tracker</h1>
      <p> This is a simple web-app that allows a person to determine the type of <em>Triangle</em> by entering its measurements. Please try it out</p>

        <input id="a" type="number" name="lengthOne" value="" placeholder="Enter lengthOne">
      <br>
        <input id="b" type="number" name="lengthTwo" value="" placeholder="Enter lengthTwo">
      <br>
        <input id="c" type="number" name="lengthThree" value="" placeholder="Enter lengthThree">
      <button type="button" name="button" onclick="triangle()"> Submit </button>
      <p>There are various shapes that exists. However, the triangle is the most challenging shape to identify depending on its properies.
